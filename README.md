# Coding_Assignment

The following mini project consists of two parts. 

The first part is based on the analysis of the titanic.csv dataset in STATA to estimate the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic cruise ship dependent on their ticket class. The first part has two .do files, that separately present the summary and analysis, and a master .do file that runs both "_summary" and "_analysis" files. 

The second part presents a short Python exercise that covers few operations on "lists" and "dictionaries" using for-loop and simple Python function.

P.S. The project does not carry any scientific values, rather this is just to showcase my basic knowledge of STATA and Python.

P.S.S If you would have any questions, please feel free to drop me an email at zhumagaziyev_sh@student.ceu.edu.

Thank you. 

Best,

Sherkhan.
